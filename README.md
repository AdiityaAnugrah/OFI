# OFI (Origin Food Indonesia)

Indonesian cuisine is very diverse and almost every province and even every region has its own
special food. However, the times have made many Indonesians begin to forget Indonesian food
and switch to modern food such as fast food. Indonesian food is also unable to compete with
foreign food, marked by the number of restaurants from abroad in Indonesia. Therefore, it is an
obligation for the younger generation to be more familiar with Indonesian food. The current
technology can facilitate the dissemination of information and facilitate the activities of many
people. One of them is machine learning which is used as a data processing technique to solve
various problems in various fields. One of the machine learning applications is image recognition.
This image recognition can be done on food objects, which will help the public to easily get
information about food and the origin of the food areas that have been detected. Detection can
be done by uploading images or taking photos directly. Food image recognition will later be
implemented into the application, so that the application does not only provide a product sale and
purchase feature but also a food image recognition feature.
